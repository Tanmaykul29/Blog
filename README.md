## Tanmay's Blog is a webser made using flask to make a project such that new users can shows off their skills in blogging.

### To share their passion
When you are passionate about something, you want to share it with the world. Whether it’s a passion for fishing, photography, or marketing, blogging is an excellent way to share that passion. When you blog about something you are passionate about, it opens the door to connecting with those around the world who speak your language and have the same passions.

### To educate others
If you are someone who loves to teach, blogging can be a platform for teaching people who have an interest in your areas of expertise. Through blogging, you will not only teach others, but you will also teach yourself more about the topic. You will learn because you will always be looking for more things to teach your readers. Teaching through blogging can naturally lead to monetization by creating online information products.

### To gain exposure
Business owners who blog increase exposure for their business in a number of ways. Creating blog content on a regular basis for your website gives Google something new to index, thus increasing your website’s visibility in search results. Creating blog content for other publications in your industry gives new, relevant audiences the opportunity to discover you and your business. This exposure gives you more traffic that you can convert into leads and customers.

### To build authority
For those that want to speak at events in their industry or become an author, blogging is a platform that you can use to build authority. As you blog about the niche you are most knowledgeable about, people will begin to recognize you as an authority in that niche. This recognition will lead to interviews, podcasts, and ultimately invitations to speak and contracts to publish a book.

### To have content to share
Social media audiences are more receptive to blog posts than they are ads or sales pages, and likewise, are more likely to share blog posts with their connections than ads or sales pages. By creating blog content, you give yourself more to share on your social media profiles, and you give your visitors something to share when they visit your website. Social sharing of your content will increase exposure to your target audiences and lead to more incoming traffic.
